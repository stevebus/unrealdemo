## Temporarly holding space for the Epic Games/Unreal and Azure Digital Twins integration


## Simulate Devices

For the sample app, we chose the [mock-devices](https://github.com/codetunez/mock-devices) tool for doing our device simluation. We primarily chose this tool for its ability to simulate multiple devices without writing code and to allow us to explicitly set the deviceIDs for our devices (to match the twinIds we use in the sample Unreal app).
